# Ezrah DIDComm Protocol: OpenID4VC Protocols

Ezrah supports the DIDComm implementation of two major OpenID for Verifiable Credential Protocols:

* `openid4vcp`: Requesting Verifiable Credentials
* `openid4vcp-presentation`: Presenting Verifiable Credentials

This document outlines how to initiate and interact with these flows using Ezrah's DIDComm protocol payload structure.

---

## Protocol Types

### `openid4vcp`

Used by an issuer (e.g., organization) to **initiate a credential issuance** process.

#### Example Payload

```ts
{
  type: "https://docs.ezrah.co/docs/didcomm-protocols/openid4vcp",
  id: verificationModel.id,
  from: organization.identifier?.did,
  body: {
    goal_code: `Login with ${organization.name}`,
    goal: verificationModel.purpose,
    verification_model: verificationModel.id,
    source: organization.name,
  },
  attachments: [
    {
      media_type: "application/json",
      data: {
        json: {
          
        }
      }
    }
  ],
}
```

##### Fields

| Field                     | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`                    | Protocol URI for openid4vcp                                                          |
| `id`                      | Unique identifier for the verification request, typically the `verificationModel.id` |
| `from`                    | DID of the requesting organization                                                   |
| `body.goal_code`          | Displayed message, e.g. `Login with Acme Inc.`                                       |
| `body.goal`               | Purpose of the verification (e.g., login, KYC, registration)                         |
| `body.verification_model` | Reference to the verification model                                                  |
| `body.source`             | Human-readable name of the organization                                              |
| `attachments`             | Contains the presentation definition required for issuance                           |

---

### `openid4vcp-presentation`

Used by a holder to **present credentials** in response to a request.

#### Expected Behavior

Upon receiving a `openid4vcp` request:

* A wallet or agent will interpret the presentation definition and construct a Verifiable Presentation.
* The holder responds with a `openid4vcp-presentation` message.

#### Example Payload (Conceptual)

```ts
{
  type: "https://docs.ezrah.co/docs/didcomm-protocols/openid4vcp-presentation",
  id: "unique-uuid-id",
  from: holderDid,
  to: verifierDid,
  body: {

  },
  attachments: [
    {
      format: "application/vc+ld+json",
      data: {
        base64: base64urlEncode(presentation)
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## `DidService.generatePresentationExchangeFormat(verificationModel)`

This helper function wraps a `verificationModel` into a Presentation Definition structure as per the Presentation Exchange specification. It is used to generate the `attachments` section of the message payload.

---

## Compatibility

* Compliant with [DIDComm v2](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/)
* Based on [OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI)](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1_0.html)
* Presentation Exchange 2.0 compliant

---

## Use Cases

* Decentralized Login
* Reusable KYC
* Verifiable Proof of Membership
* Onboarding Automation
* Trustless Access Control
* Credential Authentication
