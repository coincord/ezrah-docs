# Issuing Credentials

## Overview

This section outlines the process of issuing credentials within the Ezrah Creds platform. It details how organizations can generate and manage verifiable credentials (VCs), ensuring secure and transparent identity verification while maintaining a decentralized approach to credential storage.

## Credential Issuance Workflow

The credential issuance process follows a structured approach:

1. **Organization Registration**

    - Organizations must be registered within Ezrah to issue credentials.
    - Each organization is assigned a Decentralized Identifier (DID) for verifiable signing.
2. **Credential Generation**

    - The organization selects the credential type to issue.
    - Relevant attributes (e.g., name, verification status, timestamp) are provided.
    - The credential is signed cryptographically using the issuing organization’s DID.
3. **Temporary Credential Record**

    - Ezrah Creds maintains a temporary record reflecting the issued credential.
    - This temporary record allows for tracking issuance history but does not store the credential itself.
4. **Credential Delivery**

    - Recipients receive their verifiable credentials directly within their Ezrah Wallet.
    - The holder maintains full control over their credentials without reliance on Ezrah for storage.
5. **Verification and Revocation**

    - Third parties can resolve the issuing organization’s DID to verify credential authenticity.
    - Organizations can revoke credentials if needed, updating their status accordingly in the Ezrah system.

## Viewing Issued Credentials

Organizations and users can track issued credentials through the Ezrah Creds platform. The platform provides:

- **Credential Issuance Log:** Displays a history of issued credentials and their statuses.
- **Filtering and Search:** Enables users to find specific credentials by type, recipient, or date.
- **Revocation Status:** Indicates if a credential remains valid or has been revoked.

By standardizing the credential issuance process while maintaining decentralization, Ezrah ensures a secure and efficient verification system that aligns with self-sovereign identity principles.
