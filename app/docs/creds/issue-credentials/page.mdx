# Issuing Credentials

<Callout type="info">
  This guide explains how organizations can generate and manage verifiable credentials (VCs) using Ezrah Creds, ensuring secure and transparent identity verification with a decentralized approach.
</Callout>

## Credential Issuance Workflow

<Steps>
### Organization Registration

Organizations must be registered within Ezrah to issue credentials. Each organization receives a unique Decentralized Identifier (DID) for cryptographically verifiable signing.

### Credential Generation

- Select the credential type to issue
- Provide relevant attributes (name, verification status, timestamp, etc.)
- Credential is cryptographically signed using the organization's DID

### Temporary Record Creation

Ezrah Creds maintains a temporary record for tracking issuance history while ensuring the credential itself is not stored centrally, preserving decentralization.

### Credential Delivery

Recipients receive their verifiable credentials directly in their Ezrah Wallet, maintaining full control without relying on Ezrah for storage.

### Verification and Revocation

- Third parties resolve the issuing organization's DID to verify authenticity
- Organizations can revoke credentials when necessary, updating status in the system
</Steps>

## Tracking Issued Credentials

Organizations and users can monitor their credentials through the Ezrah Creds platform:

- **📋 Credential Issuance Log** - Complete history of issued credentials and their statuses
- **🔍 Filtering and Search** - Find specific credentials by type, recipient, or date
- **⚠️ Revocation Status** - Real-time validation status of each credential

<Callout type="warning">
  **Important:** While Ezrah maintains issuance logs for convenience, the actual credentials are stored in holders' wallets, ensuring true self-sovereignty.
</Callout>

By standardizing the credential issuance process while maintaining decentralization, Ezrah ensures a secure and efficient verification system that aligns with self-sovereign identity principles.
