## Ezrah Creds SDK — Developer Note

This document outlines how to use the **Ezrah Creds SDK**, a TypeScript interface for issuing and verifying Verifiable Credentials (VCs), managing webhooks, interacting with DID documents, and accessing analytics via Ezrah’s GraphQL API.

---

### Installation

```bash
npm install ezrah-creds-sdk
# or
yarn add ezrah-creds-sdk
```

### Getting Started

```ts
import EzrahCredential from 'ezrah-creds-sdk';

const ezrah = new EzrahCredential();
```

---

## Credential Management

### Issue a Credential

```ts
const credential = await ezrah.issueCredential({
  claimID: 'template123',
  did: 'did:example:abc123',
  claims: {
    name: 'John Doe',
    role: 'Admin',
  },
});
```

### Issue via SDK Shortcut

```ts
const credential = await ezrah.issueCredentialSDK({
  title: 'Employee Badge',
  template_claim_id: 'template123',
  claims: {
    name: 'Jane Smith',
    department: 'Engineering',
  },
});
```

---

## Credential Verification

### Create a Verification Model

```ts
const model = await ezrah.createVerificationModel({
  title: 'Employee Verification',
  purpose: 'Verify employee credentials',
  claims_match: { department: 'Engineering' },
  isser_match: 'issuer123',
  manual_verification: false,
});
```

### Fetch Verification Models

```ts
const models = await ezrah.verifcationModel();
```

### Get Verification Requests

```ts
const requests = await ezrah.verifcationRequests('model123');
```

---

## DID and Templates

### Resolve a DID

```ts
const didInfo = await ezrah.resolveDID('did:example:abc123');
```

### Fetch Templates

```ts
const templates = await ezrah.templates();
```

---

## Credential Analytics

### Get Issued Credentials

```ts
const credentials = await ezrah.issuedCredentials({
  cursor: null,
  take: 10,
  timeline: 'lastMonth',
  status: 'issued',
  template_id: 'template123',
});
```

### Fetch Credential Analytics

```ts
const analytics = await ezrah.credentialAnalytics();
```

---

## Webhook Management

### Add a Credential Webhook

```ts
const webhook = await ezrah.addCredentialsWebhook({
  request_key: 'req123',
  name: 'Credential Issued Webhook',
  webhook_url: 'https://example.com/webhook',
});
```

### Update a Webhook

```ts
const updatedWebhook = await ezrah.updateCredentialWebhook({
  webhook_id: 'webhook123',
  request_key: 'req123',
  name: 'Updated Webhook',
  webhook_url: 'https://example.com/updated-webhook',
});
```

### Delete a Webhook

```ts
const result = await ezrah.deleteCredentialWebhook('webhook123');
```

### List Webhooks

```ts
const webhooks = await ezrah.webhooks();
```

---

## Organization Management

### Get Organization Info

```ts
const orgDetails = await ezrah.organization();
```

### Upload Organization Logo

```ts
const logoUrl = await ezrah.uploadOrganizationLogo(file);
```

---

## API Key Management

### List API Keys

```ts
const keys = await ezrah.apiKeys();
```

### Create an API Key

```ts
const newKey = await ezrah.addOrganizationApiKey('New API Key');
```

### Delete an API Key

```ts
const result = await ezrah.deleteOrganizationApiKey('key123');
```

---

## Error Handling

Use `try/catch` blocks for all SDK calls to manage errors gracefully:

```ts
try {
  const response = await ezrah.templates();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Something went wrong:', error);
}
```

---

## Notes

- SDK is fully typed for TypeScript.
- Best used alongside the Ezrah [GraphQL Playground](https://your-ezrah-playground-url.com) for manual query testing.
- Keep API keys secure—use environment variables.
