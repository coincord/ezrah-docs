# Ezrah Webhook Events for Partners

When integrated with Ezrah’s credential system, partner endpoints may receive POST requests related to **credential presentations**. These events help partners verify, log, or process user interactions involving credentials.

---

## Requirements for Partner Endpoints

* Accept **POST** requests.
* Handle the following event types (sent in the JSON body):
  * `event` – the type of presentation.
  * `data` – the credential or presentation payload.
* Must verify the presence of the header `X-EZH-REQ-KEY`.

---

# Webhook Event Types

Here are the **three event types** Ezrah may send:

---

## W3C Presentation -  `w3c_presentation`

> **A Verifiable Presentation (VP)** containing one or more **W3C Verifiable Credentials**.

#### Example Payload:

```json filename="event.json"
{
  "event": "w3c_presentation",
  verification_model: {
    id: string,
    verification_title: string,
    title: string,
    purpose: string,
    verification_link: string,
    model_type: string,
    client_id: string
  },
  "data": {
    "@context": [
      "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"
    ],
    "type": ["VerifiablePresentation"],
    "verifiableCredential": [
      {
        "@context": ["https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1"],
        "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "KYC"],
        "issuer": "did:ezrah:abc...",
        "credentialSubject": {
          "id": "did:ezrah:123",
          "name": "Alice"
        },
        "proof": { ... }
      }
    ],
    "holder": "did:ezrah:xyz",
    "proof": { ... }
  }
}
```

---

## SD-JWT Presentation `sd_jwt_presentation`

> A presentation using **Selective Disclosure JWT (SD-JWT)** format, typically used for compact, privacy-respecting claims.

#### Example Payload:

```json filename="event.json"
{
  "event": "sd_jwt_presentation",
  verification_model: {
    id: string,
    verification_title: string,
    title: string,
    purpose: string,
    verification_link: string,
    model_type: string,
    client_id: string
  },
  "data": {
    "status" "VERIFIED",
    "issuer": "did:ezrah:abc...",
    "subject": "did:ezrah:123",
    "original_jwt": "eyJhbGciOi..."
  }
}
```

---

## Auth Presentation - `auth_credential_presentation`

> A lightweight presentation used during authentication flows (e.g., logging into a partner system using a verifiable credential).

#### Example Payload:

```json filename="event.json"
{
  "event": "auth_credential_presentation",
  verification_model: {
    id: string,
    verification_title: string,
    title: string,
    purpose: string,
    verification_link: string,
    model_type: string,
    client_id: string
  },
  "data": {
    "credential_type": "EzrahAccessToken",
    "issued_by": "did:ezrah:issuer123",
    "subject_id": "did:ezrah:456",
    "issued_at": "2025-06-08T12:00:00Z",
    "expires_at": "2025-06-09T12:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

# Security: Request Headers

Every webhook request includes:

| Header          | Description                                                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-EZH-REQ-KEY` | Partner-specific secret to validate authenticity of the request. |

Partners **must validate this header** matches the agreed `request_key`.

---

# Retry & Delivery Notes

Webhook requests are retried by 70 attempts based on an exponential decaying timeline. i.e it retries lesser and lesser over a long period of time.

---

# Testing Suggestions for Partners

* Set up a simple endpoint to log all incoming POST requests.
* Validate the `X-EZH-REQ-KEY`.
* Handle the three possible `event` values.
* Deserialize `data` based on event type.
