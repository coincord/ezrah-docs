# Organizations and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

<Callout type="info">
  This guide explains the relationship between Organizations and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) within Ezrah's identity and credentialing framework.
</Callout>

## Organizations

**Organizations** are structured entities (businesses, institutions, or service providers) that participate in Ezrah's decentralized identity ecosystem.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **🏢 Governance** - Operate within legal or regulatory frameworks
- **📝 Registration** - Must be registered in Ezrah's infrastructure 
- **🎭 Multiple Roles** - Act as credential issuers, verifiers, or relying parties
- **🤝 Trust Model** - Verification based on legal compliance and business agreements

## Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** are cryptographically verifiable, self-sovereign identity standards that enable authentication without centralized authorities.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **🌐 Decentralized** - Not controlled by any single entity
- **🔐 Cryptographically Secure** - Ownership validated using cryptographic keys
- **👤 Self-Sovereign** - Controlled by the keyholder without intermediaries  
- **🔍 Resolvable** - Can be resolved on-chain to fetch public keys and metadata

### Comparison Overview

| Aspect | Organizations | DIDs |
|--------|--------------|------|
| **Governance** | Centralized within entity structure | Decentralized, keyholder-controlled |
| **Registration** | Registered in Ezrah with compliance links | On-chain or off-chain registries |
| **Primary Use** | Issue, verify, consume credentials | Hold and present credentials |
| **Trust Model** | Regulatory compliance & agreements | Cryptographic proofs & blockchain trust |

## Real-World Example: KYC Provider

<Callout type="default">
**Scenario:** A KYC provider using Ezrah's dual approach

1. **Organization Registration** - KYC provider registers as an Organization within Ezrah
2. **DID Generation** - Provider generates a DID to represent its identity on-chain  
3. **Credential Issuance** - When issuing KYC credentials, provider signs using its DID
4. **Verification** - Users present credentials; verifiers resolve the provider's DID to validate authenticity
</Callout>

## Why This Approach Matters

The combination of Organizations and DIDs in Ezrah's ecosystem provides:

- **🔒 Enhanced Security** - Organizations leverage DIDs for cryptographic verifiability
- **⚡ Self-Sovereignty** - DIDs provide identity control to individuals and entities
- **🔄 Interoperability** - Seamless integration between traditional and decentralized identity models
- **📋 Compliance Balance** - Meets regulatory requirements while preserving decentralized principles

<Callout type="success">
  By combining Organizations and DIDs, Ezrah creates a robust, secure, and verifiable identity system that balances compliance requirements with true decentralized identity principles.
