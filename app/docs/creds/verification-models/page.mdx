# Verification Model

## Overview

The Verification Model in Ezrah Creds provides a structured approach for verifying credentials using Out-of-Band (OOB) verification. Organizations can create models that define the rules for credential validation, ensuring consistency and security in authentication processes.

## Creating a Verification Model

To create a Verification Model, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Verification Model Section**

    - Navigate to the Verification Model section within the Ezrah Creds platform.
    - Click on the "Create New Model" button.
2. **Define Model Parameters**

    - Enter a descriptive name for the model.
    - Select the credential types that will be verified against this model.
    - Configure validation rules, such as expiration checks, required attributes, and issuer verification.
3. **Set Verification Criteria**

    - Specify mandatory and optional attributes required for validation.
    - Define conditions for successful verification (e.g., credential issuance date, status, and issuer).
4. **Save and Activate Model**

    - Review the model configurations.
    - Click "Save" to store the model.
    - Activate the model to enable verification requests.

## Verifying a Credential Using OOB

Out-of-Band (OOB) verification allows external parties to verify credentials through a secure, controlled process.

1. **Generate a Verification Request**

    - Select the verification model to be used.
    - Provide the recipient’s details (if applicable).
    - Generate an OOB request link or QR code.
2. **Recipient Submits Credentials**

    - The recipient receives the OOB request.
    - They scan the QR code or open the link via their Ezrah Wallet.
    - They select and submit the relevant credential for verification.
3. **Automated Validation**

    - The submitted credential is checked against the Verification Model rules.
    - The system verifies issuer details, credential integrity, and expiration.
    - If all conditions are met, the credential is marked as verified.
4. **View Verification Results**

    - The verification status (Success/Failure) is displayed.
    - Organizations can view detailed logs of the verification process.
    - If verification fails, the system provides insights into failure reasons (e.g., expired credential, incorrect attributes).

## Managing Verification Models

Organizations can manage existing Verification Models within the Ezrah Creds platform:

- **Edit Models:** Modify validation criteria, add/remove credential types.
- **Deactivate Models:** Temporarily disable a model without deletion.
- **Delete Models:** Remove outdated or unused models from the system.
- **View Logs:** Monitor past verification attempts and results.
